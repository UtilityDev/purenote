Hey, welcome to purenote, a home for your thoughts.

## How to get started?
You can begin by writing down anything - regular notes, ideas, thoughts or emotions, journal/diary entries, or just something you need to remember later. You can create as many notes as you wish. When you're done, simply close the site and return when you feel ready to take more notes. Your notes are always saved locally, so you never lose them!
Due to focusing on minimalism, some design decisions may seem strange at first glance. To delete a note, first delete all content in it and then press backspace on an empty note to get rid of it.
